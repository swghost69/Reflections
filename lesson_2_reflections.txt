What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need 
to do it?

I create a hidden .git folder. I need it to store all my repo-
sitory data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is for you to store the files that are ready for commitment to the repository while working directory is where you modify your files. Staging area is a buffer for you to make your final decision before you do your commitment.
